- 👋 Hi, I’m @NickAllan71
- 👀 I’m interested in Blender, CGI, SQL, C#, Python, heck this is starting to sound like a CV.  I'm really intereested in collaboration with other like-minded folk, which is why I signed up to GitHub after all.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Blender
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating animations, such as the short clips I've posted in https://www.instagram.com/_nicolas_allan_/
